        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is one of the first soups that I learned to make by myself. I found this recipe on YouTube and it never dissapoints. This is a soup
            that can be freezed and stored for a long period of time as well.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat pot to medium-high heat and add the olive oil and tortilla strips. Wait for it to get hot, remove the crsipy tortilla strips, then add

                let the mixture simmer to reduce
            </li>
            <li>After the chicken has cooked through (~20-30 minutes), pull out the chicken and shred it</li>
