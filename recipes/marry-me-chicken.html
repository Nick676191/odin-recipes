        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Marry-me chicken is one of my favorite pasta recipes to make with chicken. It creates a rich and creamy sauce that tenderizes the chicken 
            wonderfully. Furthermore, if cooked correctly, a proposal may be imminent due to the deliciousness of the meal.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 Lbs boneless skinless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>3 minced cloves garlic</li>
            <li>0.5 Tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>0.25 Tsp dried thyme</li>
            <li>0.5 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>0.5 Lb bacon</li>
            <li>16 Oz angel hair pasta</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>0.5 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>0.25 cup chipping cream</li>
            <li>0.25 cup sun-dried tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts on a flat work surface. Slice horizontally through the middle, being careful not to cut all the way through 
                to the other side. Open the 2 sides and spread them out like an open book to butterfly.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large, oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic, oregano, thyme. Saut√© until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add chicken and cook until golden brown but not fully cooked, 3 to 4 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4 cup chicken broth into the skillet and bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the centers and juices 
                run clear, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. 
                Drain bacon slices on paper towels and let cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes; chop.</li>
            <li>At the same time, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, 
                until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Remove skillet from the oven and transfer chicken to a plate, reserving juices in the skillet. Keep chicken warm and place skillet on 
                the stovetop.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour into the skillet over medium heat. Add remaining chicken broth, Parmesan cheese, and whipping cream. Whisk until combined.</li>
            <li>Add sun-dried tomatoes, red pepper flakes, and salt. Add bacon and chicken back into the skillet.</li>
            <li>Serve on top of hot cooked pasta.</li>
        </ol>
